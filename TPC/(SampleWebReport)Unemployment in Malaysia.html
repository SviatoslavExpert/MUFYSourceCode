<p style="max-width:850px">The scenario given is about the unemployment issue in Malaysia. Data regarding unemployment of 14 states in Malaysia has been collected. 
Reliable and valid websites such as Trading Economics, Data.Gov.My et cetera are used for the data collection to ensure the accurancy and reliabality of the data.
The data collection is gathered only to the extent of comparing the factors that cause unemployment in Malaysia and the problems associate with unemployment. 
The objective of gathering this information is to observe any relationships or patterns between the collected data, hence presenting any evidence to support or refute the 
hypotheses generated. Remarkably, there are two hypotheses generated prior to the data analysis which are <i> "higher GDP growth rate could lead to a lower unemployment rate
due to economy producing more goods and services thus many labour force will be employed" </i> and <i> "high number of unemployed persons will cause a high number in crime as jobless 
people tend to be associated with crime".</i></p>


<br>

<h6 class="FClass"><i><b>Note</b>: Unemployment is a situation in which there are people in an economy who are willing and able to work, 
but are jobless. To achieve full employment, there should be no cyclical unemployment
in the economy. Cyclical unemployment occurs when a country's economic growth is slowing down or declining. 
However, it is impossible to achieve 0% unemployment rate due to various factors such as: </i></h6>

The source of the data regarding unemployment in Malaysia is from reports research made by economist, organization and central bank.
The data collection is done using the monitored and observed websites. Thus, this 
lowers the chances of gathering inaccurate data which may alter the outcome. There are a few data gathering techniques used which are as follows:</p>


<p style="max-width:850px"><b>1. Reporting : </b> Data regarding GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, unemployed person and crime rate in Malaysia 
are obtained from Trading Economics which is an instituition that is in charge of investigating and collecting data regarding this matter for every country in the world.</p>

<h4>Hypothesis 1</h4>
<h4 align="justify" style="max-width:850px" class="HFont"><b>The higher GDP growth rate, the lower unemployment rate
due to economy producing more goods and services thus many labour force will be employed</b></h4> 
 <div class="circle"></div>
  <div class="circle"></div>
  <div class="circle"></div>
  

<div class="center-justified"> 
 <p style="max-width:850px"><b> EXPLANATION   &#9998 </b>  The hypothesis is generated to study whether is it true or false that Malaysia's GDP growth rate will 
 impact unemployment rate. GDP is the final value of goods and services in the market, produced within a country's border in a given period of time. It is used to measure 
 a country's economic growth as an increase in GDP indicates a positive economic growth and vice versa. In particular, it is assumed that job opportunities in the economy 
 would increase if the economic is progressing well and producing more. This is because during a positive economic growth, businesses will become more confident to 
 increase production of goods and services and invest more to maximise their profits. In order for businessess to increase their production, they need to employ more labour force 
 thus leading to a rise in the job market and lower unemployment rate. </p>
 </div>

  <br>
  
<div class="center-justified"> 
 <p style="max-width:850px"><b> IMPORTANCE   &#9998 </b>  The hypothesis is important as it can prove that GDP growth rate could affect unemployment rate in Malaysia.
 That being the case, early steps can be taken in order to ensure Malaysia's economic growth will always stay in an upturn
 and will not go into a recession so, Malaysia's unemployment rate will 
 not rise beyond the accepted range set by government. Therefore, government could as well implement new strategies to control GDP growth rate in future. </p>

 <p align="justify" style="max-width:850px"><b> RESULTS   &#9998  </b> The GDP growth rate for every quarter from 2013 to 2015 is obtained from reporting.
 Meanwhile, the unemployment rate for every 3 months are added to derive the average rate quarterly. This data then is compared to one another to observe the relationship
 between these two variables.</p>

<figcaption><b>Figure 3</b>: Summary of unemployment rate vs GDP growth rate</figcaption></figure>

 <br>
 
 

 <p align="justify" style="max-width:850px"><b> JUSTIFICATION  &#9998 </b>  By observing the graph, it is obviously stated that in the second and third quarter of 2013,
 GDP growth rate has increased compared to the previous quarter which caused the unemployment rate for these two quarters in 2013 to decrease compared to the previous quarter.
 However, in the third quarter of 2014, despite GDP growth rate falling, the unemployment rate did not rise. This is because during this period of time, according to 
 (Utusan Online, 2014), the government and nongovernment instituitions worked hand in hand to help the unemployed person in securing a job especially in industrial economy.
For the following quarters until the end of 2015, it is shown that as GDP growth rate fall, there is a rise in the unemployment rate. 
 Indisputably, it is verified that higher GDP growth rate could lead to a lower unemployment rate unless when there are outside factors that support employment in Malaysia. 
 This manifests that the data analyzed can substantiate the hypothesis.</p>

<h4>Hypothesis 2</h4>
<h2 align="justify" class="HFont" style="max-width:850px"><b> 2. The higher number of unemployed person, the higher number of crime as jobless people tend to 
commit crime </b></h2>
 <div class="circle"></div>

  <div class="circle"></div>
  </div>
<div class="center-justified"> 
 <p style="max-width:850px"><b> EXPLANATION   &#9998 </b>  This hypothesis is made to identify the relationship between number of unemployed person 
 and the crime rate in Malaysia. Crime rate is a measure of the number of crimes recorded in a particular area, over a given period of time. 
 According to research, unemployment is a crucial factor because the person is marked by the deterioration of living standards. Besides, his emotional 
 structure becomes unstable and the family will be affected. That being so, the unemployed person might in the end succumb to their desires and commit crimes
in order to continue with their living expenses (Dumitru, 2012). </p>
 </div>
 
<br>
<div class="center-justified"> 
 <p style="max-width:850px"><b> IMPORTANCE   &#9998  </b> This hypothesis is essential as it can demonstrate the interrelationship between number of unemployed person 
 and number of crime in Malaysia. Therefore, government can prevent crime rate from increasing by controlling unemployment rate which is the main reason of this complication.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:17px"><b> &#9630 Outcomes of the test </b></h3>
<div class="center-justified"> 
 <p style="max-width:850px"><b> RESULTS   &#9998  </b> The monthly data for number of crime and unemployed person for every states from 2013 until 
 2015 are obtained from reporting. Then, the data is added together to get the average value of the 3 years. Similar to hypothesis 1, these two variables are compared
 to one another to observe the patterns and relationships.</p>

</figure>
<br>

 <div class="center-justified"> 
 <p style="max-width:850px"><b> JUSTIFICATION  &#9998 </b> By observing the graph, it is shown that Sabah has the highest average of unemployed person among all 
 but the average number of crime in Sabah is fewer compared to more than half of the 14 states with only an average of 4856 crimes. It is also shown that Kuala Lumpur 
 with a smaller average of unemployed person has a larger average of crime compared to Johor which has a larger average of unemployed person but with smaller average of crime. 
 Overall, state with higher average of unemployed person does not indicate that its crime rate will be high too. This is because, crime is not solely
done by people who are facing money shortage problem but instead by people who are not being raised well. As seen, crime rate in more developed states are higher
than the still developing states. This is due to parents in more developed states tend to work overtime and spend less quality time with their children thus,
 leading them to have the audacity of doing anything that they like including immoral acts. Hence, this proves that the data analyzed can refute the hypothesis. </p>

<div class="center-justified"> 
<p style="max-width:850px">In conclusion, based on all the analysis that has been constructed, it can be concluded that the first hypothesis can be substantiated as the 
rise in GDP growth rate can cause a fall in unemployment rate in Malaysia. When Malaysia's economy is doing exceptionally well, it could be seen that the unemployment rate 
will fall. On the contrary, the second hypothesis can be refuted. This is because, an increase in average number of unemployed person does  not reflect an increase in average number of crime.
In future, the analyzed data used for both hypotheses can still be improved  by using a larger sample of the country and collecting data for at least a decade
to improve the reliability and accuracy of the findings. </p> </div>
