#Introduction  
The tree map above shows the relative size of each state of Australia. Australia is a very large country with a size greater than 7, 600,000 square kilometres and is divided into six states and two territories.  

#Graph type and purpose  
The type of graph used in the visualisation is a tree map. Tree maps are used to visually compare different items to each other.
The size of each rectangle used in the tree map is in proportion to amount of data it represents.     

#Data included  
Data included in this tree map is the size of each state (and territory) of Australia measures in square kilometres.  

#Main findings/trends
The largest state in Australia is Western Australia with a size of 2, 529, 875 square kilometres. This makes up over 32% of all of Australia, followed by Queensland and the Northern Territory.
While Tasmania makes up less than 1% of Australia.  

#Other findings  
The two states with the highest population, New South Wales and Victoria, are two of the smallest states in terms on size, while the Australia Capital Territory is so small you can just see it on the tree map.
Source of the data
The data was collected from Wikipedia, although the original source is listed as Geoscience Australia on the Wikipedia page.    

#Conclusion  
Australia is one of the biggest countries in the world. The largest state in Australia, Western Australia is bigger than most other countries in the world.  
New South Wales and Victoria are two of the smaller states in the country making up just over 13% of Australia, but over 57% of the population live in these two areas.  












#SA1 Example  
The graph displays the number of people living in a particular state.
The graph used to represent the population data is a pie chart. Pie Chart are used to show comparison between data of different categories in proportion to the total data of all categories.
The population of each states are represented as slices of the pie chart while different colours are used to represent identify the state of that slice.
The main finding in the trend is that New South Wales has the largest population in Australia.
Australian Capital Territory has the smallest population compared to the other states in the Data. Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia have more than 1 million people living in them.
The source data came from Australian Bureau of Statistics, their websiteâ€™s Address is www.abs.gov.au
Overall, the chart shows that the population of New South Wales is the biggest.
